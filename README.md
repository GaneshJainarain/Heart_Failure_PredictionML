## When dealing with machine learning problems, there are generally two types of data (and machine learning models):

- `Supervised data:` always has one or multiple targets associated with it.
- `Unsupervised data:` does not have any target variable.

A supervised problem is considerably easier to tackle than an unsupervised one. A problem in which we are required to predict a value is known as a supervised problem. 
For example, if the problem is to predict house prices given historical house prices, with features like presence of a hospital, school or supermarket, distance to nearest public transport, etc. is a upervised problem. 
Similarly, when we are provided with images of cats and dogs, and we know beforehand which ones are cats and which ones are dogs, and if the task is to create a model which predicts whether a provided image is of a cat or a dog, the problem is considered to be supervised.
